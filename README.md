## Airline on-time performance
Have you ever been stuck in an airport because your flight was delayed or cancelled and wondered if you could have predicted it if you'd had more data? This is your chance to find out.

## Dataset

> This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008.
> - See more information from the data expo in 2009 [here](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009).
> - See a full description of the features [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?QO_VQ=EFD&Yv0x=D.)
> - Data can be downloaded from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7).

This is a large database over 12 GiB in size, and therefore will be excluded from GitHub.

TODO: Summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

TODO: Design questions to answer, examples:
- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
- Do older planes suffer more delays?
- How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
- How well does weather predict plane delays?
- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
